## The Challenge

You have the entire month of November to create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

What do we mean by **loosely** based on hacking, modding and/or augmenting? We literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be:

* an endless runner where you *hack* down binary trees in your path with a pixelated axe,
* a *modern* take on a classic e.g. a roguelike set in a 3D or VR world, or
* an *augmented* reality game bringing octopus/cat hybrids into the real world.

Unleash your creativity. You can work alone or with a team and build for any platform or device. The use of open source game engines and libraries is encouraged but not required.

We'll highlight some of our favorites on the GitHub blog, and the world will get to enjoy (and maybe even contribute to and/or learn from) your creations.

The official Twitter hashtag for the Game Off is `#ggo16`. We look forward to playing with your creations.

GLHF! <3
